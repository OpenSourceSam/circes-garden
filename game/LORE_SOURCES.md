# Lore Sources

## Purpose

Define canonical and secondary lore references for Circe's Garden v3 so writing, art prompts, and cutscene content stay consistent.

## Source Priority

1. **Primary Canon:** `Circe - Madeline Miller.txt`
2. **Secondary Detail Reference:** https://circe.fandom.com/wiki/Circe_Wiki

## Usage Rules

- Treat the novel text as final authority when conflicts appear.
- Use the wiki for fast lookup, relationship reminders, and scene detail expansion.
- If wiki details conflict with the novel, follow the novel.
- Keep story beats aligned with game canon decisions:
  - Potion fails.
  - Scylla is not cured.
  - Ending centers on acceptance, not reversal.

## Where This Applies

- Dialogue writing and revisions
- Character visual briefs
- Prologue/cutscene image prompts
- Flavor text and quest descriptions

## Linked Specs

- `game/ASSET_GENERATION_V3.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
